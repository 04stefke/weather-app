## About
My name is Stefan Jovanovic. I am a front-end developer, this is a basic weather application.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- Enter a location for the wanted city weather
- Should see the weather condition and icon for it
- See the temperature and the city name
- See the humidity percentage and the wind speed
